The first profile can be characterized as a machine learning course, where a lot of focus was given to the standard machine learning algorithms wether they be supervised or unsupervised. As well as machine learning, the profile also focused on the creation of multiagent systems, where communication between agents was imperious. The second profile essentialy focused on teaching the principles in database exploration and administration.",
